## Occipital Bone Morphology and Activity Patterns

Occipital bone traits show consistent sexual dimorphism, but whether subsistence-based biomechanical loading contributes additional variation has been poorly understood. This project examined metric and nonmetric occipital traits across nine skeletal collections (n=663) representing hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists, and agriculturalists using two-way ANOVA and discriminant function analysis. All five outcome variables showed significant sex effects; bicondylar breadth and lambda-inion distance also varied by subsistence practice, suggesting a biomechanical signal in traits subject to adult remodeling. Foramen magnum area achieved only 71% sex estimation accuracy -- above chance but insufficient for forensic use -- and adding bicondylar breadth as a second predictor reduced rather than improved accuracy, reflecting biomechanical loading as noise in condylar sex estimation.
